WORK IN PROGRESS

Procedurally Generated endless runner made in Unreal Engine 5

This generation is built off of a Spawn Handler (spawnhandler.cpp in Source) that will spawn in new Grid Templates 
in three different directions (Forward, Left, Right). On these templates will be obstacles in the form of vehicle traffic, 
as well as powerups for the player to collect that will increase the Game Timer. Each template is spawned in according to 
the direction the player is traveling and where an appropriate grid can spawn next. The "Seed" for this generation is based
on this direction (ex. Forward - 0, Left - 1, Right - 2). 

Different powerups and vehicle types are still being added and built on top of the procedural generation features that
are currently implemented. 

This project is currently in progress with a deadline for submission on 02/17/2024.
